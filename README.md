# Knora-projects-metadata
Metadata ontology for Knora Projects

This ontology is an attempt to define the common metadata required for humanities datasets hosted within [Knora](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora) framework.

According to the **FAIR principles** and **SFNS recommandation**, these metadata should be made available in a separate files from the project-specific ontology and the dataset itself. See http://www.snf.ch/en/theSNSF/research-policies/open_research_data/Pages/data-management-plan-dmp-guidelines-for-researchers.aspx: 

> Does the repository allow the upload of intrinsic (e.g. author's name, content of dataset, associated publication, etc.) and submitter-defined (e.g. definition of variable names, etc.) metadata?

> Are the citation information and metadata always (even in the case of datasets with restricted access) publicly accessible?

> Does the repository provide a submission form requesting intrinsic metadata in a specific format (to ensure machine readability/interoperability)?

The current state of this ontology is a first draft to discuss and amend. 
It is mainly based on [DCAT ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-vocab-dcat-20140116/) (which itself relies heavily on [Dublin Core terms](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/)).
